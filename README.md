Use the indicators for screen the stocks from Thailand Stocks market
In the following code, the criteria for selecting stocks are as follows:

P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):
- The trailing twelve months (TTM) P/E ratio should be less than 20.
- The P/E ratio indicates how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. A lower P/E ratio may suggest that the stock is undervalued relative to its earnings.

Dividend Yield:
- The dividend yield should be greater than 2%.
- Dividend yield represents the annual dividend payment as a percentage of the stock's current price. A higher dividend yield may indicate that the stock provides better returns through dividend income.

Market Capitalization:
- We'll include stocks with a market capitalization greater than 1 billion THB. This helps filter out smaller, less established companies.

Return on Equity (ROE):
- We'll consider stocks with a Return on Equity greater than 10%. ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.
